# KeeperFX - Unofficial release

As of 2020-08-24 this project will continue back at the original project. The unofficial branch has officially taken over from the original official branch as the new official branch so we officially drop the unofficial name from the formar unofficial branch and continue this unofficial branch as the new official branch at the location of the old official branch.
